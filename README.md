## Installation

```ruby
bundle add administration-zero
```

You'll need to create a model to be administrated, if you don't have one. for this example let's use the following:

```
rails generate model posts title:string body:text published:boolean
```

## Usage

```
rails generate admin:install
```

Then run `bundle install` again

Then run `rails db:migrate db:seed`, you can access the admin panel in `/admin`, using `email: "admin@example.com", password: "Password9957"`


Now you're ready to generate your admin scaffolds.

```
rails generate admin:scaffold posts title:string body:text published:boolean
```

## Development

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
